# 🩺 AI-Powered Patient Data & Lab Report Processing System

An AI-driven healthcare assistant that collects patient information, extracts insights from lab reports, asks smart follow-up questions, and generates a **Doctor Dashboard** + **Structured PDF Report** to simplify medical consultations.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Patient Data Collection**

  * Basic fields: Name, Age, Gender, Weight, Height, Blood Group, Vitals, Symptoms
  * Lab report uploads (PDFs, images)

* **AI Processing**

  * Extracts key medical insights from lab reports
  * Highlights abnormal values and potential risk factors
  * Asks smart follow-up questions for missing critical details

* **Doctor-Ready Outputs**

  * **Interactive Dashboard**:

    * Patient summary
    * Highlighted lab results
    * Possible diseases / areas of concern
    
  * **PDF Report**:
    * Easy to share with doctors
    * Structured for quick review
    * Includes demographics, history, and lab findings

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

**App (Frontend)** → **Backend API (FastAPI + AI Models)** → **AI Processing Layer** → **Outputs (Dashboard + PDF Report)**

Workflow:

1. Patient submits personal details + uploads lab reports via app.
2. Backend AI extracts and processes structured + unstructured data.
3. AI asks follow-up questions for missing information.
4. Unified patient profile is generated.
5. Doctor views results in **dashboard** or downloads **PDF report**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js / React Native (for mobile app)
* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), LangGraph / LangChain for AI orchestration
* **AI/ML**:
  * LLMs (OpenAI OSS via Groq) for NLP & Q\&A
---

## 📊 Benefits

* Saves doctors’ time by summarizing scattered patient data
* Ensures **no critical detail is missed**
* Improves **doctor–patient communication**
* Provides **portable medical records** for consultations & telemedicine
* Scalable to hospitals, clinics, and insurance systems

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

* **AI Accuracy** → Human-in-the-loop verification for critical values
* **User Adoption** → Training & onboarding for doctors
